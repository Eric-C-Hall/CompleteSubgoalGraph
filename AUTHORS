Created by Eric Hall.

Parts of this code are based on the Brigitte code by Alban Grastien, although the vast majority of it is my work.

Code in the PathCompetition folder and both main files are based on code provided by the GPPC organisers: https://movingai.com/GPPC/code.html.

The maps in the maps folder are from the movingAI benchmarks, with the exception of those in the manually-created folder, which I created.
